Date: 2026-10-08  
Evidence label: `experimental-negative`

## Reproducibility boundary

- Mod base: `87b0b149065f97be17c2867a781ea5cad5c20e69`
- Model: `Qwen/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B`
- Hardware: 2 x Ascend 910B2, TP2
- Runtime: CANN 9.1.0, vLLM 0.23-derived StateAxis, eager mode,
  `max_model_len=2048`
- AgentX first-turn prompt sizes: 328, 457, 648, and 1033 tokens

No unmodified three-turn AgentX segment fits the 2048-token limit, so the
round makes no multi-turn claim. The native concurrency-2 control completed;
the experimental path failed closed because it currently admits a single
decode request.

## Result

Exact SVD plus four boundary power iterations passed a 128-token real-shadow
request, but its component amortized ratio was 22.280x native and boundary
refits took about 32–33 ms. It fails the no-harm gate.

A cheap rank-four sketch whose boundary discarded the prior compensator failed
the 2% real-shadow relative-RMS gate at step 22. Reusing exact SVD initialization
with that boundary failed at step 37, identifying boundary information loss as
the dominant problem.

Preserving and scaling the old rank-four compensator passed the component gate:
maximum component output relative RMS was 0.0079148, amortized ratio 0.979686,
and batched ratio 0.468530. In the real Qwen3.5-35B shadow run it failed at
`language_model.model.layers.17.linear_attn step=65` with relative RMS
0.023863366. That is progress in failure distance, not a qualified speedup.
Replace-mode testing was not run after the exactness failure.

The earlier quant-only candidate was also rejected: it was 0.44% slower in
median request time and 0.37% slower in median ITL than the warmed native
control, while three of four output hashes differed.

## Probe correction

The server may emit HTTP 200, partial SSE output, and then an embedded engine
error. `tools/agentx_online_probe.py` now requires both a finish reason and
terminal usage. Two unit tests cover accepted completion and truncated-200
rejection.

Validation completed with 23 StateAxis parser tests, five Ascend Python
component tests, and two probe tests passing. A fresh AscendC build produced
the library used in the real runs; a later reuse of its generated tree hit a
CANN preprocess `unknown file type` failure and is classified as an
incremental-build infrastructure failure.

## Decision

Do not merge or enable the experimental kernel. The next candidate should
retain the prior rank-four factors, sketch the newly accumulated residual,
and cheaply recompress the combined rank-eight update to rank four on Cube.
It must pass the unchanged 2% layer-by-layer real-shadow gate before any
replace-mode measurement.
